XCode on MacOSX Lion seams to use an outdated version of clang. In this version
clang yields warnings like these:


In file included from source/transaction.cpp:32:
In file included from ./include/transaction.h:42:
./include/object.h:290:22: warning: 'odb::CObject::ParentGet' hides overloaded virtual function [-Woverloaded-virtual]
    virtual CObject* ParentGet(long nIndex);
                     ^
./include/root.h:129:36: note: hidden overloaded virtual function 'odb::CRoot::ParentGet' declared here
    virtual const CMapReferencing& ParentGet();
                                   ^


These warnings are invalid. Later versions of clang (e.g. on Ubuntu) do not do
this error anymore.

I'm sorry for this inconvinience, but regarding that this is an error in an old
clang version, I will do nothing about the problem but hope that Apple will
upgrade Lion's clang version soon.

WRONG!

clang 2.1 was right. See here:
